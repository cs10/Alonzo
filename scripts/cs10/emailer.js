    <h3> Hello ${studentName} and Welcome to CS10!</h3>

        You're receiving this email because you filled out a late add form and told us that you added the class on: ${joinDate.toDateString()}
        <br>
        What this means for you is the following:
        <br>
        <ul>    
            <li> You need to get labs 1-8 checked off (in lab) by the time that we have the quest on: ${cs10.questDate.toDateString()}</li>
            <li> You need to complete reading quizzes 1-4 before the quest. Talk to your TA to set up times in lab to take your quizzes. These quizzes must be taken in lab</li>
            ${lateAddAssignments}
        </ul>

        Additionally, please make sure that you have access to the following sites: 
        <ul>
            <li> our class question/answer forum on piazza.com </li> 
            <li> the cs10 class on bcourses.berkeley.edu (this is how you will see your grades) </li>
            <li> take a look at the assignment calendar and course policies at cs10.org </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        If you have any other questions please don't hesitate to talk to your TA. ${taName} can be reached at: ${taEmail}, 
        but TAs don't like emails very much so try to go see ${taName} in lab or office hours (which you can find at cs10.org).
        <br>
        <br>
        Thanks!
